# Unhandled Exception in Express.js JSON Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where exceptions are not handled during the processing of JSON request bodies. When a request body is malformed or missing a required property, the application crashes instead of gracefully handling the error.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in the `/user` POST route, which processes incoming JSON data. If the request body is missing or malformed, meaning it does not contain the expected properties (like 'name' in this case), accessing those properties will result in an unhandled exception, causing the server to crash. 

## Bug Solution
The solution involves implementing comprehensive error handling.  This is achieved by checking if the request body is valid and contains the necessary properties before accessing them. If the body is invalid, a proper error response should be sent to the client.  Input validation is also crucial to prevent unexpected data from causing problems.
